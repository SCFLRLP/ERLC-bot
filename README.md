SCRP Tutorial: Install this using `git clone https://github.com/SCFLRLP/ERLC-bot.git` or `git clone https://github.com/SCFLRLP/ERLC-bot.git DIRECTORYNAME` then install discord.js: `npm install discord.js` and then we recommend going faster so init an NPM to this `npm init -y` then you should be all good!

edit all of the items you may need on the server-side **DO NOT FORK THIS AND PASTE YOUR BOT TOKEN OR ERLC API TOKEN THIS WILL LEAD TO A HIGH RISK OF SOMEONE TAKING IT AND USING IT AGAINST YOU** but yeah! if you need anything just submit to issues or head to our discord: https://scflrlp.com/discord and we would be happy to help!
